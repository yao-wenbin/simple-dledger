# simple-dledger
a simple project to help you understand DLedger Component and the implementation of Raft Algorithm better.

I first know DLedger because of RocketMQ 5.0's Clustering Architecture.

DLedger is a Component in Open Messaging Library that is an implementation of **Raft Algorithm** and  helping RocketMQ to Achieve Automated Failed Switch.
